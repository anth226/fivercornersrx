            <p>
                By setting up an account with FiveCornersRx, you establish a customer relationship that allows you to access and utilize the features of the Site Offerings as a user. You may provide personal information such as your name, email address, mailing/billing address, and telephone number to FiveCornersRx as part of this relationship. This information is not considered “protected health information” or “medical information”.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, when you request Prescription Medications or certain FiveCornersRx Products, you may also provide health or medical information that is subject to protection under applicable laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and related regulations. FiveCornersRx is not a “covered entity” under HIPAA, but our Healthcare Providers are covered entities, and we may be a “business associate” of the Healthcare Providers in some cases. It is important to note that HIPAA may not apply to all of your transactions or communications with FiveCornersRx. If we are deemed a “business associate,” we may be subject to certain provisions of HIPAA regarding “protected health information” (PHI) that you provide to the Healthcare Providers. Any medical or health information that is subject to specific protections under applicable state laws, together with PHI, is defined as “Protected Information” and will only be used and disclosed in accordance with such applicable laws. However, any information that does not constitute Protected Information may be used or disclosed in any manner permitted under this Privacy Policy. Protected Information does not include information that has been de-identified in accordance with applicable laws.

                <li>
                    Online Analytics To better understand and improve the experience of our users, we may use third-party web analytics services like Google Analytics and Cartstack on our Services.

                    To deliver relevant content and advertising for FiveCornersRx products on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use, the Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies, such as ad networks and ad servers from Facebook, Google Ad Words, YouTube, Bing, Criteo, and others. These technologies use cookies and other tools to collect data on factors like the content of the page you are visiting, demographic data, information you enter, and other information we collect from you. The ads you see may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services.
                    <br />
                    We may provide our customer information, such as email addresses, to service providers who may match this information in de-identified form to cookies and other proprietary IDs to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.
                    <br />

                    This Privacy Policy does not govern, and we do not have access to, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device by non-affiliated third-party advertising network services. However, you can generally control cookies from being put on your device by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out link, or Your Online Choices to opt-out of tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. For more information about Criteo's privacy practices or opting-out of Criteo's advertising services, you may view their Privacy Policy. If you are interested in opting out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customizing Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
                    <br />
                    Please note that even if you exercise any of the opt-out choices, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.

                    Mobile Advertising When you use our mobile applications, you may receive in-application advertisements that are tailored to you. To deliver these ads, we may use third-party service providers or conduct mobile application analytics. Each operating system provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. For example, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices all have their own settings for controlling personalized in-application advertisements. If you wish to opt out of tailored in-application advertisements, you should contact the platform provider for further details on how to do so.
